Power BI Dashboard
The objective is to create a Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Grands, a hotel chain facing declining market share and revenue in the luxury/business segment. The dashboard should provide key business insights using historical data to help the company make data-driven decisions, regain market share, and improve revenue. Additionally, it should include relevant metrics and insights beyond the provided mock-up to address current business challenges.


Identify Key Metrics: 
Understand the metrics that have been defined in the metric list. These will likely include:
1)Revenue (total revenue, room revenue, F&B revenue, etc.)
2.Occupancy Rate
3.Average Daily Rate (ADR)
4.Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR)
5.Booking trends
6.Customer segments (business vs leisure, geography, etc.)
7.Seasonality patterns
8.Market share compared to competitors

Key Insights:-
Declining Market Share in High-Season Periods:
Identify any seasonal trends in market share and revenue. For example, "AtliQ Grands' revenue from business travelers decreased by 15% in Q2 2024 compared to last year, indicating a loss in high-season bookings."
Room Type Performance:-
If certain types of rooms are underperforming, suggest price adjustments or marketing focus. "Standard rooms have an occupancy rate of 60%, while premium rooms have 85%. Consider promotional offers for standard rooms to boost occupancy."
Booking Lead Time vs. Occupancy:-
Identify how lead time influences occupancy. "Bookings made 30+ days in advance have a 10% higher occupancy rate than last-minute bookings. Focus on early-bird offers to increase advanced bookings."
